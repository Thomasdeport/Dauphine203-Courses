  // ========================
  // TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
  // ========================
  {category: "Technical", question: "Explique les principaux grecs", answer: "Delta: sensibilité au spot. Gamma: variation du delta. Vega: sensibilité à la volatilité. Theta: effet du temps. Rho: sensibilité au taux."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Donne une position gamma long et vega short", answer: "Un straddle est gamma long et vega long. Pour être vega short et gamma long, on peut combiner un straddle long avec une vente d’options plus longues maturités."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Quel est l’avantage d’un modèle SLV ?", answer: "Il combine le fit exact de la smile (Local Vol) et la dynamique stochastique réaliste (Stochastic Vol). Il reproduit mieux la surface implicite dans le temps."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Qu’est-ce qui renvoie le prix le plus élevé entre SLV et Local Vol ?", answer: "Le modèle SLV, car l’ajout de volatilité stochastique augmente la convexité du payoff."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Définition d’un Autocall", answer: "Produit structuré offrant un coupon conditionnel et un remboursement anticipé si le sous-jacent dépasse une barrière à certaines dates."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Forward price avec et sans dividendes", answer: "Sans dividendes: F = S₀ e^{rT}. Avec dividendes: F = S₀ e^{(r−q)T} ou F = (S₀ − PV(div)) e^{rT}."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Impact des dividendes sur un Autocall", answer: "Des dividendes plus élevés réduisent le forward, diminuant la probabilité d’autocall — donc le produit offre un coupon plus élevé."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Formule Black-Scholes Call", answer: "C = S₀ e^{−qT} N(d₁) − K e^{−rT} N(d₂)."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "FX Forward formule", answer: "F = S₀ e^{(r_d − r_f)T}."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Comment se hedger contre risque de taux ou de crédit ?", answer: "Risque de taux: swaps, futures, duration matching. Risque de crédit: CDS, diversification, collatéralisation."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "C’est quoi une dichotomie ?", answer: "Méthode numérique de recherche de racine utilisée pour trouver la volatilité implicite."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Lien entre delta, gamma, theta", answer: "Gamma positif implique un delta qui varie vite avec le spot. Theta est négatif pour une position longue option. Gamma et theta sont de signe opposé."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Trader, pricer une vol implicite plus haute ou basse que le marché ?", answer: "Un vendeur d’options pricera une vol plus haute pour se protéger du risque de volatilité future."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Pricing d’une obligation", answer: "Prix = somme des cash-flows actualisés. Duration = sensibilité au taux. Convexité = correction de second ordre."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Différence LCR / NSFR", answer: "LCR = ratio de liquidité à 30 jours. NSFR = ratio de financement stable à horizon long terme (1 an)."},
  {category: "Technical", question: "Qu’est-ce qu’un Swap (IRS, TRS, CDS)", answer: "IRS: échange taux fixe/variable. TRS: échange performance d’un actif contre taux. CDS: protection contre défaut de crédit."},

  // ========================
  // BRAINTEASER QUESTIONS
  // ========================
  {category: "Brainteaser", question: "Combien de zéros à la fin de 100! ?", answer: "Nombre de 5 dans 100! = 100//5 + 100//25 = 24 zéros."},
  {category: "Brainteaser", question: "Cube 10×10×10", answer: "Volume 1000. 8 sommets, 12 arêtes, 6 faces selon le contexte."},
  {category: "Brainteaser", question: "Dice Payoff", answer: "Calculer espérance selon la distribution des sommes (2 à 12) : E = Σ p(x) × payoff(x)."},
  {category: "Brainteaser", question: "Bibliothèque Python avec recherche tolérante", answer: "Représenter par un dictionnaire {'id': 'titre'}. Recherche robuste via .lower() et fuzzy matching (difflib, fuzzywuzzy)."},
  {category: "Brainteaser", question: "Roulette russe avec deux balles consécutives ou non", answer: "Deux balles consécutives augmentent la probabilité de survie après premier tir (car dépendance des événements)."},
  {category: "Brainteaser", question: "Marche aléatoire sur carré 3×3", answer: "Espérance de sortie ≈ 4–6 pas depuis le centre (simulation Monte Carlo possible)."},
